## Getting Started

If you want to include neccesary momentjs locales add your locales at ./plugins/moment.js TODO line then uncomment moment plugin in next.config.js file

Set your i18n translations remote address at ./plugins/i18n.js first line then run:

```bash
npm run i18n
# or
yarn i18n
```

If you want to generate your types from OpenApi json file set your file address at package.json "api" script then run:

```bash
npm run api
# or
yarn api
```

To Format your code with Prettier run:

```bash
npm run format
# or
yarn format
```

To Format + Lint and type check your code just run:

```bash
npm run ci
# or
yarn ci
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.tsx`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
